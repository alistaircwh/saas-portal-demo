# Vigilant Asia MTD Portal — CLAUDE.md

## Product Context

This is the marketing and sales website for **Vigilant Asia**, a Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) product targeting Malaysian businesses and consumers. The product is powered by Zimperium technology.

**Sales motion:** We give prospects a warm pitch first (in person, WhatsApp, referral), then direct them to this site to either subscribe directly or submit a contact enquiry. The site exists to close warm leads, not to generate cold traffic. Copy should be confident and reassuring — the visitor has already heard the pitch.

**Primary CTAs:** "Subscribe Now" (direct purchase) and contact form (for larger/business accounts that need a conversation first).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.2.4 (App Router) — this version has breaking changes vs older Next.js; read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before touching routing or rendering patterns

- **Animations:** `tw-animate-css` + project motion language (see [Motion & Interactions](#motion--interactions))
- **Language:** TypeScript strict mode
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Supabase, accessed via Prisma 7 with the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter
- **ORM:** Prisma 7 — schema at `prisma/schema.prisma`, generated client at `lib/generated/prisma/`

## Brand & Design

- **Brand name:** Vigilant Asia
- **Primary color:** `#C41E1E` (red) — mapped to `text-primary` / `bg-primary`
- **Background:** Near-black (`#080808` / `#0C0C14`) with card surfaces in `bg-card`
- **Font:** Geist Sans (Google Fonts via `next/font`)
- **Tone:** Confident, warm, jargon-free. We talk to non-technical business owners and professionals — avoid security jargon unless explaining it immediately.

---

## Key Conventions

- All section anchor IDs: `#hero`, `#how-it-works`, `#pricing`, `#contact` (Footer)
- Contact page lives at `/contact`; the footer (`id="contact"`) serves as the in-page contact anchor on the home page
- `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional Tailwind classes
- `buttonVariants()` from `@/components/ui/button` for consistent button styles
- Server components by default; add `"use client"` only when state/interactivity is needed
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious

---

## Motion & Interactions

The site has a deliberate, restrained motion language. **Reuse it; don't invent new curves or durations.** All animations gate on `prefers-reduced-motion` via a global rule in `app/globals.css`.

**Design tokens** (defined in `app/globals.css` `@theme inline`):
- `--ease-premium: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — the one easing curve for almost everything
- `--ease-out-soft: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` — reserved for lifts/scales
- `--dur-fast: 150ms` — hover / focus feedback
- `--dur-standard: 350ms` — state changes, reveals, accordion, toggle pill
- `--dur-ambient: 700ms` — slow background drifts

**Keyframes** (in `app/globals.css`):
- `va-rise` — opacity 0 + translateY(12px) → 0; used by `.va-reveal`
- `va-glow-drift` — slow background-position oscillation (12s loop on the hero radial)
- `va-popular-pulse` — slow red box-shadow breath (4s loop, Pricing's Family tier only)
- `va-check-draw` — stroke-dasharray draw-on for the contact success SVG check

**Reusable primitives:**
- `<Reveal delay={ms}>` (`components/Reveal.tsx`) — wrap any element/section for an on-scroll fade+rise. One-shot (does not re-animate on scroll-up). Hero uses it on mount; sections use it on scroll. Stagger siblings with `delay`.
- `useReveal()` (`components/useReveal.ts`) — the underlying hook; returns a ref to attach to a node.
- `.va-reveal` CSS class — the styling layer used by `<Reveal>`; reveals when `data-revealed="true"` is set.
- `.va-link-underline` — underline-from-left on hover/focus. Used on navbar links and (via `.va-link-group` parent) on footer email/WhatsApp.

**Established interaction patterns** — copy these instead of inventing new ones:
- **Sliding toggle pill** (`components/Pricing.tsx`): refs on each button, one absolutely-positioned `<span>` indicator whose `left`/`width` transition via `--dur-standard`.
- **Smooth accordion / mobile menu expand** (`components/FAQAccordion.tsx`, `components/Navbar.tsx`): always-mounted inner panel inside a `grid` wrapper that animates `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr`. No height measurement, no JS animation.
- **Cross-fading value swap** (Pricing price digits): wrap the changing value in a span keyed off the changing state (`key={years}`) plus `animate-in fade-in-0 zoom-in-95 duration-200` from `tw-animate-css`.
- **Card hover language** (`components/ui/card.tsx`, baseline): `hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:ring-foreground/20`. Inherited by every Card on the site. Don't add big scales or rotations.
- **Reduced-motion is the floor, not the ceiling.** Never write an animation that bypasses the global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule.

**Things we deliberately do NOT do:** parallax, autoplay carousels, marquee strips, floating particles, bouncy springs, hero typewriters, custom cursors, hover scales > 1.02. If a future change wants one of these, push back.

## Database

Hosted on **Supabase** (PostgreSQL). Prisma 7 manages the schema and migrations.

**Two connection strings** — both required in `.env`:

| Variable | Port | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | 6543 | App runtime (`lib/prisma.ts`) | Transaction-mode pooler (`pgbouncer=true`) — optimised for serverless |
| `DIRECT_URL` | 5432 | Prisma CLI (`prisma.config.ts`) | Session-mode pooler — required for DDL/migrations |

**Common commands** (run from project root):

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>   # create + apply a new migration
npx prisma migrate deploy                      # apply pending migrations (CI/prod)
npx prisma generate                            # regenerate client after schema change
npx prisma studio                              # browse data in the browser
```

Always run `npx prisma generate` after editing `prisma/schema.prisma`. The generated client in `lib/generated/prisma/` is gitignored — never edit it manually.

**Schema summary** — key models: `User`, `Company`, `Package`/`PackagePrice`, `Order`/`OrderItem`, `Payment`/`PaymentEvent`, `Subscription`/`License`, `PromoCode`, `Document`, `AuditLog`, `EmailLog`, `LoginHistory`. See `prisma/schema.prisma` for full detail.

## Running Locally

```bash
cd mtd-portal
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run lint
```

---

## Tests

Playwright e2e tests live in `tests/`. Config: `playwright.config.ts` (Chromium only). `baseURL` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` but reads from `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` env if set — useful when Next falls back to port 3001 because something else holds 3000.

```bash
cd mtd-portal
npx playwright test                                        # run all 29 tests
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npx playwright test   # target alt port
npx playwright test --ui                                   # interactive UI mode
```

Test files:
- `tests/api.spec.ts` — API contract tests for `POST /api/contact` (valid payload → 200, missing required fields → 400)
- `tests/contact.spec.ts` — Contact page: form renders, submit state, success/error UI
- `tests/home.spec.ts` — Homepage: title, navbar, section anchors, pricing toggle, FAQ accordion, mobile nav

**Playwright selector gotchas (strict mode):**
- Use `exact: true` or `getByRole("heading", { name: "..." })` when text appears in multiple elements
- FAQAccordion heading is **"Common questions"** (not "Frequently asked")
- Pricing tier headings must use `getByRole("heading")` — tier names appear in multiple nodes
- The FAQ panel and mobile menu are **always in the DOM** (collapsed via `grid-template-rows: 0fr`). Assert `toBeVisible()` after expand, not `toHaveCount(0)` before.
- The Pricing term toggle has a sliding indicator `<span>` *behind* the buttons — the active "selected" styling lives on that span, not the button itself. Assert on text/aria-pressed, not on the active background class.

**Known stale tests:** `tests/home.spec.ts` lines 66–84 reference a Monthly/Annual toggle that no longer exists (the UI is 1/2/3-Year). These two tests have been failing since before the pricing UI changed and should be rewritten against the current term toggle.

---

## Browser Verification

Use **MCP Playwright** (`mcp__playwright__*` tools) to verify UI changes and test website functionality at `http://localhost:3000`. Use it whenever:

- A UI or layout change needs visual confirmation
- A feature's behaviour needs to be verified in the browser (navigation, forms, toggles, animations)
- A fix requires end-to-end validation before reporting completion

Typical verification flow:
1. `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` → `http://localhost:3000`
2. `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` to inspect rendered state
3. `mcp__playwright__browser_click` / `mcp__playwright__browser_fill_form` for interactive flows
4. `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` if a visual record is useful

Always verify the golden path (page loads, primary CTAs work, pricing toggle works) after any change that touches layout, routing, or interactive components.

## Known TODOs / Stubs

- `app/api/contact/route.ts` — currently only `console.log`s enquiries; needs email (e.g. Resend) or CRM integration
- `lib/payment/ipay88.ts` — iPay88 payment provider skeleton; not yet implemented (set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock` for local dev)
- `lib/provisioning/zimperium.ts` — Zimperium license provisioning skeleton; not yet implemented (set `PROVISIONING_PROVIDER=mock` for local dev)
- `lib/email/index.ts` — email sending is mocked; wire up Resend (or similar) for production
- `app/api/dev/` — `seed/` and `demo/` routes are dev-only helpers; **delete before deploying to production**
- WhatsApp link in Footer uses placeholder `wa.me/60XXXXXXXXX` — replace with real number
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links are `href="#"` placeholders
- `tests/home.spec.ts` lines 66–84 reference a non-existent Monthly/Annual toggle and need rewriting against the 1/2/3-Year term toggle (see Tests section)
